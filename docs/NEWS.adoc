GEGL-0.4.16 2019-05-07
----------------------

Buffer
~~~~~~

Swapped behavior of cubic interpolation from cubic to mithcell coefficients,
leading to crisper results in all uses of the cubic sampler.

Use a custom allocator for tile data which aligns data and groups allocations
in blocks - improving performance on windows by keeping more slack allocation
memory in-process. On linux the opposite was needed and is achieved by using
the GNU extension malloc_trim which permits forcing invokation of the glibc
malloc/free allocators garbage collection function.

Permit tiles to be unreffed after GEGL shut-down without crash, which is
likely when using bindings to dynamic languages.

Improved deadlock prevention in gegl_buffer_copy() when using copy on write.

Core
~~~~

Platform specific build fixes for both win32 and OSX.

Avoid in-place processing for cached nodes.

Indentation consitency improvements.

Permit more detailed specifying/overriding of OpenCL device through the
GEGL_USE_OPENCL environment variable.

New call gegl_update_anim_time for applying the animation curves of properties.

Build
~~~~~

Added gitlab continuous integration.


Operations
~~~~~~~~~~

Use indirect buffer inputs on main thread during multi-processed processing for
point-filters/composers and tranform base classes.

Smaller required/invalided ROI for map-absolute/relative when
using nearest neighbor.

tiff-save and jpg-save fixed dimensions when buffer saved has non-zero origin

Added missing descriptions of properties for cubism, mosaic, tile-paper, color,
mantiuk06 and vignette operations.

ff-load fix some of the deprecation warnings.

ff-save avoid crashing if audio or video codec fails to initialize.

cache, parent class changed - it is no longer a point operations, also speed up
processing and permit copy on write handling of tiles.

opacity and invert - crash for 8bpc buffers, reimplemented logic for
(non-)associated alpha OpenCL kernel selection.

Tools
~~~~~

Drop direct dependency on exiv2 - we now only transiently depend on it through
the gexiv2 abstraction.

commandline tool/gui
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Store per image editing chains in .gegl folder instead of sidecars.

Set window title, permit interaction with opened .lui documents, fixed playback
of audio for opened videos - it now works; if the video is decoding, scaling
and display is fast enough to leave spare cycles.

Support for nearest neighbor scaling of imagry; aiding video playback without
dropping audio frames.

Custom collection order and per-file key-value metadata.

UI
~~

The existing microraptor-gui (immediate mode touch UI+CSS with cairo) image
viewer that can be built as part of the gegl binary has been revisted, a
graph/property editor has been added, and migration/extension to lua has begun
for parts of the code.

WARNING: many parts of the UI is of exploratory proof of concept/alpha quality
but are released since the code is part of the GEGL repository and important
development tools both for creating and testing new GEGL operations as well as
GEGL itself.

Some screenshots showing some the process towards the state and capabilties of
the UI in this release can be seen at https://www.patreon.com/posts/24123574

To build with this UI the following dependencies also need to be satisifed, for
now this is not intended to be packaged by distributions yet.

  libluajit-dev
  lua-lgi        (debian package name) upstream:
  mmm            https://github.com/hodefoting/mmm
  mrg            https://github.com/hodefoting/mrg

Features:
  folder view
  resolution independent UI
  touch oriented navigation
  GIF / video playback
  PDF pagination
  goats that expose performance and capabilty issues in GEGL
  efficient (though not sandboxed) thumbnailing
  embedded simple commandline

GEGL-0.4.6 2018-07-23
---------------------

Up until now GEGL has been using a color space corresponding to scRGB as an
unbounded device independent/possibly scene-referred HDR color space - with a
similar approach to to how ACEScg works but with a worse set of RGB primaries.
babl formats, represented by a pointer and a corresponding encoding/format
string have been used to specify the specific encoding of pixel values. The
encoding including component order, data type and TRC encoding.  Where "RGBA
float" means 32bit float data and "R'G'B' u8" the ' indicates non-linear, and
thus this is sRGB.  "RaGaBaA half" gives premultiplied linear half data. Other
encodings and conversions are also provided through these formats including
"CIE Lab float" and "HSV float".

As a color management workflow for scene-referred imaging the above could be
sufficient, but GIMP needs data in the 0.0-1.0 range for some display referred
blending modes to work properly. As a consequence of this recognized
short-coming GIMP has been passing the pixels of for instance ProPhoto "R'G'B'A
float" off as "R'G'B'A float" and linear ProPhoto "RGBA float" as "RGBA float"
this works for single operations, but falls apart when the colors are converted
to CIE Lab. This is the good enough state where the other benefits of having a
stable release powered by GEGL outweighed not being entirely correct.

Since babl 0.1.32 of october 2017, all babl formats have an associated
unchangable space associated with them, and since then GeglBuffer has worked
correctly with it - since GeglBuffers use of babl API did not change.  GIMP is
already using these parts of babl for ICC matrix based conversions since using
babl for ICC profile transforms is an order of magnitude faster than using the
lcms2 library.  It took time to come up with the above scheme of integrating
arbitrary primaries and curves for spaces with babl in a maintainable manner,
and it has taken until the last month to come up with a full plan for the rest
of GEGL to be aware of and handling arbirary parametric ICC v2/v4 based color
spaces for operations; without limiting the ability to extend and use the code
for a wide range of scenarios.

A space can be constructed from a preferenced name/specification, loaded/saved
from ICC matrix profiles or constructed and serialized to whitepoint + rgb
chromaticities / xyz matrix. More recently an additional trc mark has been
added '~', giving this vocabulary for RGB formats, in addition to variants with
alpha and pre-multiplied alpha variants of the same:

 "RGB"     linear      primaries from space, linear data
 "R'G'B'"  non-linear  primaries from space, TRCs from space
 "R~G~B~"  perceptual  primaries from space, sRGB TRC

When creating device independent CIE based spaces they also get passed a space,
this means that we can convert CIE Lab to RGB float, keeping track of which
space / ICC profile the data correspond to.

GEGL operations now construct their desired encodings of formats by taking the
space of buffers on input pads into account. By default, for composers "input"
wins over "aux" to determine ops space. If an operation is not ported, data
will be converted to sRGB on input and sRGB will come out of the node.

Buffer loaders PNG, JPG, TIFF and EXR generate custom spaces based on ICC
profiles/primaries. The corresponding savers saves color space information.
A new save handler for the .icc extension, acts like an image storer but
only saves the ICC profile of the buffer it gets on input.

With no additional operations inserted, this now means that GEGL graphs operate
on linear / non-linear variants of the color space used in the input images
without conversion. The new operations gegl:cast-space and gegl:convert-space
provide means of overriding this behavior, see the new section about color
management in the gegl-chain syntax documentation at
http://gegl.org/gegl-chain.html

Initial work has started on making GIMP also use of and propagate color space
information along with encoding in babl formats, changes which also will be
integrated in the 2.10 branch.

Other changes to operations:

GEGL-0.4.2 2018-05-15
---------------------

Build
~~~~~

Abort early if autoreconf fails, remove unused bits, default to -Ofast as
CFLAGS.

GeglBuffer
~~~~~~~~~~

Improve concurrency for trimming and destruction of tile caches. Improve cache
invalidation during partial mipmap regeneration.

Do new cheap clones of buffers with new internal gegl-buffer backed
tile-backend.

Do not keep cached sampler in buffer it makes cache invalidation hard, and for
performance/threading it is better to create ones own samplers anyways. The old
API still exists, though parts of it is now deprecated. The single special case
where gegl_buffer_sample remains somewhat performant is with the NEAREST
sampler, for all other samplers creating a caching sampler is better.

Operations
~~~~~~~~~~

operation: add GeglOperationAreaFilter::get_abyss_policy() vfunc Copyright
notice improvements to spherize, color-overlay.  ff-save: implement defines
handling compilation with ffmpeg 2.3-2.7, 4.0 compat.

GEGL 0.4.x is a stable release series of GEGL to have a stable API and ABI to
go with GIMP-2.10. When the need arises to break API or ABI compatibility the
0.4.x series will get its own branch and unstable API experiments and
development, 0.5.x will happen in master. For now though master will track the
0.4.x series.

retouching zenith, nadir or other arbitrary gaze directions in equirectangular,
also known as 360x180 panoramas.

Added abyss-policy to base class for scale ops, making it possible to achieve
hard edges on rescaled buffers.

GEGL-0.3.30 2018-03-19
----------------------

GeglBuffer:
~~~~~~~~~~~

gegl_buffer_get now treats the final argument, which used to control only abyss
behavior as a bit-field that also can have interpolation method to use when
scaling down from the next larger mipmap level, valid values are
GEGL_BUFFER_FILTER_NEAREST, GEGL_BUFFER_FILTER_BILINEAR,
GEGL_BUFFER_FILTER_BOXFILTER and GEGL_BUFFER_FILTER_AUTO.

All scaling is now done on linear data, making future results of mipmap
computations more valid as well as providing correct results for scaled down
thumbnails in user interfaces. Optimized code paths have been added for 8bit
buffers (using 12bit linear as processing space) and other formats like 16bit
float are now correctly handled by going through generic code paths.

The scaling code paths has also been instrumented and optimized for
performance. Improvements to pixel data fetching and setting functions leads to
performance boosts across many GEGL operations, as well as display code paths
in GEGL using applications. For some performance critical display cases
performance should have improved 2-3x over last release.

Improvements to logic switching to boxfiltering behavior and improve cubic
samplers box filtering by using a linear sampler and a nearest sampler for the
boxfiltering for the linear sampler. This slows down scaling down with the
cubic sampler by half, but is less prone to aliasing, while keeping the faster
code paths for the fast but not as bad as nearest - bilinear.

gegl_buffer_copy gegl_buffer_clear and gegl_buffer_set color now only
emit a single changed signal on the buffer.

Operations:
~~~~~~~~~~~

c2g and stress have gained the ability to toggle the influence of the shadow
neighborhood or not, the new default is to not improve shadow detail; yielding
a bit more natural renditions.

color-to-alpha now contains improvements from experiment in workshop which is
gone.

Fixed crahses in median-blur.

Transform ops:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only rasterize inside the transformed polygon, saving cpu. The optimizations
mentioned for GeglBuffer giving boosts and improved quality.

New ops:
~~~~~~~~

Mean-curvature blur.

News ops in workshop:

color-overlay, enlarge, inpaint, domain-transform, recursive=transform.

---------------------

- Renamed gegl:load-buffer to gegl:buffer-source and gegl:save-buffer

  pure command line tool (which can still visualize stuff with help
  help the SDL based display operation)
- Consider {x=G_MININT/2, y=G_MININT/2, width=G_MAXINT, height=G_MAXINT}
   as the only valid region in which processing may occur. Processing
   outside of this region is undefined behaviour.
