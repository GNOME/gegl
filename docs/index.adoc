*GEGL* (Generic Graphics Library) is a data flow based image processing
framework, providing floating point processing and non-destructive image
processing capabilities to

projects (link:https://github.com/imgflo/imgflo/[imgflo],

processing pipeline. GEGL provides operations for

link:operations/GeglOperationSink.html[storing],
link:operations/color.html[color adjustments],
link:operations/artistic.html[GIMPs artistic] filters and more
forms of link:features.html[image processing] GEGL can be used
on the link:commandline.html[command-line] with the same syntax
that can be used for creating processing flows interactively
with text from link:https://barefootliam.blogspot.com/2022/12/gegl-plug-ins-for-gimp-part-two-gegl.html[GIMP using gegl-graph].
