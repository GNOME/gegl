The Poly2Tri-C is a three-part library, where all parts are licensed
under the same license - The BSD 3-Clause License (also known as "New
BSD License" or "Modified BSD License"):

  1. Constrained Delaunay Triangulation - Based on the code of Poly2Tri
     (Poly2Tri is licensed under the same license)
  2. Delaunay Refinement - New code implemented in this library
  3. Mesh Rendering - New code implemented in this library

The first part of the library is a port of the Poly2Tri library from C++
to C (with GLib). This port can be found inside the poly2tri-c/p2t
directory of this source code distribution.

The second part of the library is an implementaiton of a Delaunay
Refinement algorithm named "The Terminator" which appears in a paper
written by Jonathan Richard Shewchuk.
The implementation of the algorithm in C was done by Barak Itkin, and it
can be found inside the poly2tri-c/refine directory of this source code
distribution.

Finally, the third part of the library contains various techniques to
render mesh objects as raster/vector images. This part is 'original' and
is not based on any other reference. This code can be found inside the
poly2tri-c/render directory of this source code distribution.
